    <h1>Drunken Baked Beans</h1>

        <p>​​Some people think that if they’ve had one pan of baked beans at a barbecue, you’ve had them all. These people have never had drunken baked beans. They may look identical, but one taste is all it will take for them to realize this is not your average pan of baked beans. No, these are “frijoles borrachos,” sort of.  Real frijoles borrachos are simply simmered in a pot, but cooking methods aside, these beans feature the same not-so-secret ingredient that makes all the magic happen. Beer!! </p>
